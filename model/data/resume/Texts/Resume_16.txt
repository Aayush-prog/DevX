Work Experience

o Full-stack Development Intern, Hypergrid Inc., San José June 2018—Present

- Developed REST endpoints for several new features in the platform's latest release, making them available to the customers.

- Migrated the Solr dependencies to Postgres to improve application availability and maintainability, reducing memory usage by
almost 20%.

- Optimized the VM provisioning by integrating Redis in-memory caching, substantially speeding up the data intensive operations.

- Integrated machine learning based VM recommendation engine to the platform, makes VM configuration recommendations
based on user requirements, reducing the usage cost.

Technologies: Java, Springboot, Gradle, JavaScript, Angular JS, Python, PostgreSQL, RESTFul web services

o Application Developer, Accenture, India August 2016—May 2017
- Enhanced and maintained enterprise Java applications in Spring MVC and AngularJS.
- Designed scripts for automated reporting of product data using Python and Shell scripting, substantially reducing the time
needed for generating reports previously completed manually.
- Contributed to the development of Accenture Automatic Ticket Resolver, aimed at reducing the average issue resolution time to
2 hours
Technologies: Java, JavaScript, Angular JS, JQuery, Shell Scripting, Python, Maven, PL/SQL, RESTFul web services

o Undergraduate Research Intern, Indian Institute of Technology, Patna, India May 2015—July 2015
- Created an aspect-based sentiment classifier for online user reviews. More fine-grained sentiment analysis, giving the review for
each aspect in a review.
- Developed models for automatic extraction and classification of aspect terms and sentiments using both Conditional Random
Field (CRF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Technologies: Java, Shell Scripting, Machine Learning, Support Vector Machines.

Relevant Projects

o End-to-End Speech Recognition Using Recurrent Neural Networks
