WORK EXPERIENCE

Fellow in Authentication Team, European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) September 2020 — Present
* Built permanent 2FA for Keycloak. Rolled new SSO to 10k+ users with 80k logins per day. Geneva, Switzerland

+ Setup compromised password check to protect $100M LHC control machines from unauthorized access;
resolved 1,177 compromised accounts.

+ Maintained 99.9% service availability of Keycloak, troubleshooted time-critical issues manually.
* Built Cl/CD pipelines with custom Dockerfiles; reduced deploy time by 4 minutes, saving 200+ dev hours per year.
+ Setup Grafana using Prometheus metrics to alert for system downtime via email, Slack, and Telegram.

* Created a custom Flask JSON logger @' to improve log monitoring using Kibana; saved at least 5 dev hours per week.
+ Automated Keycloak configuration management using Puppet, reducing deploy time by 50%.
* Developed an API to manage OIDC and SAML registrations, reducing manual efforts significantly.

Technical Student in Computer Security, European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) September 2018 — October 2019

+ Developed an incidence response system for copyright infringements (average 50 cases per week). Geneva, Switzerland
* Built an anomalous login activity system in Golang for CERN VMs; alerted user within 10 seconds of login breach.
* Created Puppet modules to install and configure RPM packages, reducing manual effort by 50%.
