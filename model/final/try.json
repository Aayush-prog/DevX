    "title": "CVAT Task Specification: Training/Test Mode for Annotation Tasks",
    "description": "Project Description:\nWe are seeking a skilled <span class=\"highlight\">software</span> <span class=\"highlight\">engineer</span> to implement a new feature in CVAT that allows designating annotation tasks as \"Training\" or \"Test\" mode. This feature will provide different permissions to annotators regarding access to quality analytics and ground truth data, enabling more effective training and evaluation of annotators.\n\nProblem:\nCurrently, CVAT lacks a mechanism to differentiate between annotation tasks used for training purposes and those used for testing annotator performance. \n\nDesired Solution:\nWe require a solution that modifies CVAT to allow designating tasks as \"Training\" or \"Test\" with the following functionalities:\n\nTask Mode Selection:\nA new option should be added to the task creation page, allowing the task creator to select the task mode as either \"Training\" or \"Test.\"\nThis selection can be implemented as a checkbox or a dropdown menu.\n\nAnnotator Permissions:\nTraining Mode (this is the default setting):\nAnnotators assigned to a \"Training\" task will have permission to:\n- View their individual Quality Analytics score.\n- View conflicts between their annotations and the Ground Truth.\n- All other permissions and functionalities for the annotator will remain the same as in the standard CVAT workflow.\n\nTest Mode:\nAnnotators assigned to a \"Test\" task will not have permission to:\n- View their individual Quality Analytics score.\n- View conflicts between their annotations and the Ground Truth.\n\nGround Truth Visibility:\n- The Ground Truth data for a task should be completely hidden from annotators in \"Test\" mode.\n- The Ground Truth data should be visible to the task creator (supervisor) in both \"Training\" and \"Test\" modes.\n\nSkills Required:\nProficiency in Python and Django (CVAT backend).\nExperience with PostgreSQL database.\nFrontend development skills (React).\nGood understanding of REST APIs.\nExperience with Git and version control.\n\nDeliverables:\n- Modified CVAT codebase with the implemented solution.\n- Clear documentation of the changes made.",
