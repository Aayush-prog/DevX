Data Scientist,"Project Description:
We are seeking a skilled software <span class=""highlight"">engineer</span> to implement a new feature in CVAT that allows designating annotation tasks as ""Training"" or ""Test"" mode. This feature will provide different permissions to annotators regarding access to quality analytics and ground truth data, enabling more effective training and evaluation of annotators.

Problem:
Currently, CVAT lacks a mechanism to differentiate between annotation tasks used for training purposes and those used for testing annotator performance. 

Desired Solution:
We require a solution that modifies CVAT to allow designating tasks as ""Training"" or ""Test"" with the following functionalities:

Task Mode Selection:
A new option should be added to the task creation page, allowing the task creator to select the task mode as either ""Training"" or ""Test.""
This selection can be implemented as a checkbox or a dropdown menu.

Annotator Permissions:
Training Mode (this is the default setting):
Annotators assigned to a ""Training"" task will have permission to:
- View their individual Quality Analytics score.
- View conflicts between their annotations and the Ground Truth.
- All other permissions and functionalities for the annotator will remain the same as in the standard CVAT workflow.

Test Mode:
Annotators assigned to a ""Test"" task will not have permission to:
- View their individual Quality Analytics score.
- View conflicts between their annotations and the Ground Truth.

Ground Truth Visibility:
- The Ground Truth data for a task should be completely hidden from annotators in ""Test"" mode.
- The Ground Truth data should be visible to the task creator (supervisor) in both ""Training"" and ""Test"" modes.

Skills Required:
Proficiency in Python and Django (CVAT backend).
Experience with PostgreSQL <span class=""highlight"">database</span>.
Frontend development skills (React).
Good understanding of REST APIs.
Experience with Git and version control.

Data Scientist,"Project Description:
We are seeking a skilled software <span class=""highlight"">engineer</span> to implement a new feature in CVAT that allows designating annotation tasks as ""Training"" or ""Test"" mode. This feature will provide different permissions to annotators regarding access to quality analytics and ground truth data, enabling more effective training and evaluation of annotators.

Problem:
Currently, CVAT lacks a mechanism to differentiate between annotation tasks used for training purposes and those used for testing annotator performance. 

Desired Solution:
We require a solution that modifies CVAT to allow designating tasks as ""Training"" or ""Test"" with the following functionalities:

Task Mode Selection:
A new option should be added to the task creation page, allowing the task creator to select the task mode as either ""Training"" or ""Test.""
This selection can be implemented as a checkbox or a dropdown menu.

Annotator Permissions:
Training Mode (this is the default setting):
Annotators assigned to a ""Training"" task will have permission to:
- View their individual Quality Analytics score.
- View conflicts between their annotations and the Ground Truth.
- All other permissions and functionalities for the annotator will remain the same as in the standard CVAT workflow.

Test Mode:
Annotators assigned to a ""Test"" task will not have permission to:
- View their individual Quality Analytics score.
- View conflicts between their annotations and the Ground Truth.

Ground Truth Visibility:
- The Ground Truth data for a task should be completely hidden from annotators in ""Test"" mode.
- The Ground Truth data should be visible to the task creator (supervisor) in both ""Training"" and ""Test"" modes.

Skills Required:
Proficiency in Python and Django (CVAT backend).
Experience with PostgreSQL <span class=""highlight"">database</span>.
Frontend development skills (React).
Good understanding of REST APIs.
Experience with Git and version control.
